\textit{"When one teaches, one is not teaching subjects, but people.}

\textit{The things that I teach—primarily conducting and composition—are pretty esoteric and have to do very much with the development of self-confidence in the student. I bring the kids out of themselves, so that they can explore their own inner poetry.}

\vspace{1em}

\textit{My task is to make my students understand that conducting, for instance, is the synthesis of all the various things that we study, such as history and harmony, and that the conductor is the galvanizer of all of this information when interpreting a score and seeing what the vision of a composer is.}

\textit{My emphasis has always been to train the complete musician. That's the way I've operated all my life."}
